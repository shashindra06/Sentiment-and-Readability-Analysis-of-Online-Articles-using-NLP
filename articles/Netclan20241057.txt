Client BackgroundClient: A leading insurance firm in the globeIndustry Type:  InsuranceServices: SaaS, Products, InsuranceOrganization Size: 10000+Project ObjectiveDevelop the recommendation engine 
Item-based collaborative filtering based on the use case of the project
Work on Streaming data platform i.e BangDb 
Data Generation for Testing the platformProject DescriptionBangDB is the platform that manages the static data stored on the cluster and also works with live streaming data as Hadoop does. Wherever the bangdb is able to manage machine learning model deployment with their inbuilt parameter and hyper tuning parameters for each model.Streaming data from the client which relates to the customer details and the numbers of products offered by the client on their platform, such as Insurance, loans (Business Loans and Personal Loans), Mobile recharge, UPI transactions done by their platform, etc. They wanted the recommendation of other services provided by them to each of their customers who are using their platform.Our SolutionThis Project Module develops according to the Clients Requirements which involves item-based collaborative filtering based on customer behaviour, Firstly classify the customers into various segments on the basis of age, location, gender, and product usage. On the basis of RFM (marketing tactics to classify the customer on the basis of their purchase history, amount spend, and frequency of usage of product) classify them and recommend them the other services based on item-based collaborative filtering.We generated the synthetic data (90 Million events) for the testing of the recommendation model and its accuracy for recommending the other products to customers.Project Deliverables       –   KPI of the Customers       –   Recommendation model       –   Graph databased model       –   Data Generation code based on python (using copula-based on PyTorch)      Tools usedBangDb Tool (ML, AI, NoSQL database supported)

Measure the RFM score, and group and classify them based on their scores.
Graph database provides to reduce complexity and increase the processing speed.
Data generation is one of the difficult tasks and generating relational data across 29 different streams using copula and UUID python library function which is based on PyTorch.Business ImpactIt is Qualitative and Quantitative impact on economically where customers are a direct impact of these projects in their life.
It is suggesting to the customers what services they have to utilize from the provider and this is a direct impact of the product on the customers.
Product is providing the action statement of the usage of services by the customers and impacts them economically as well.
The scope impact of product service is Nationwide or statewide.
