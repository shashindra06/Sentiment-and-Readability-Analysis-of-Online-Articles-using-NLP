Design & Develop BERT Question Answering model explanations with visualization

By Ajay Bidyarthy -   September 16, 2022  8968 





Client BackgroundClient: A Leading Tech Firm in the USAIndustry Type: IT ConsultingServices: Software, ConsultingOrganization Size: 100+Project DescriptionWe need to use a pre-trained bert question answering model and create a notebook that has explanations of model’s working with some visuals of bertviz, allennlp and gradient values.Our SolutionWe created a notebook first and explained the model with model view and head view visuals of bertviz library. It gives similarity between words so we can easily find related words.We used the allennlp library and created bar charts and heatmaps to show higher and lower attention words. It means when it finds question related words in the context it gives higher value to those words and if words are not related it gives lower values. We used a gradient based method to show higher and lower gradient values word according to question text and created bar charts and text color charts to show higher gradient values.Project DeliverablesA notebook which has an explanation of the bert question answering model using some visualization.Tools usedGoogle colab notebooks, Tensorflow, Bertviz, Allennlp, TransformersLanguage/techniques usedPython programming language, Deep learning, NLP, Data VisualizationModels usedPretrained bert-base-uncased model and distilbert model (both trained on squad2 dataset) Skills usedData visualization, Deep learning, NLP, python What are the technical Challenges Faced during Project ExecutionWe need to use the best pre-trained model which can give good results on different questions and answers.We were working on text data so we need to use charts which can clearly show differences between higher attention and lower attention value words.  How the Technical Challenges were SolvedFor best pretrained we tried different Bert’s pretrained models like distilbert(trained on squad dataset), distilbert(trained on squad2), bert base uncased, bert large and roberta base.Among these models we kept the best one. For solving charts related issues we used heatmap chart, bar chart with dark and light colors and text coloring method.Project Snapshots
