PowerBI REST API – Fetching Dataflow and Refresh Schedules with semantic models

By Ajay Bidyarthy -   August 25, 2024  5124 





Client BackgroundClient: A leading IT & tech firm in the USAIndustry Type: ITProducts & Services: IT Consulting, IT Support, SaaSOrganization Size: 200+The ProblemOur client, a large enterprise, faced significant challenges in managing their Power BI dataflows, datasets, and refresh schedules across multiple workspaces. The manual processes were time-consuming, error-prone, and lacked real-time monitoring capabilities. They needed an automated solution to streamline these tasks, ensure data accuracy, and improve overall efficiency.Our SolutionWe developed an automated system using Python that integrated with the Power BI API to manage and monitor dataflows, datasets, and their refresh schedules. The solution provided a comprehensive overview of all workspaces, datasets, and dataflows, including detailed transaction data and refresh schedules. This system allowed the client to efficiently track and manage their Power BI environment, reducing manual effort and improving data reliability.Solution ArchitectureData Retrieval:Utilized the Power BI API to fetch dataflow transactions, datasets, and refresh schedules.
Employed MSAL for secure authentication and authorization.Data Processing:Processed and transformed the retrieved data using Pandas.
Consolidated data from multiple sources into a single Excel file with multiple sheets.Data Storage:Stored processed data in an Excel file, ensuring easy access and further analysis.DeliverablesPython script for automated dataflow and dataset management.
Comprehensive Excel file with detailed information on dataflows, datasets, and refresh schedules.
Documentation and user guide for the solution.Tech StackTools usedPython: Primary programming language.
Power BI API: For interacting with Power BI services.
MSAL: For authentication and authorization.
Pandas: For data processing.
Requests: For making API calls.
Openpyxl: For Excel file operations.Language/techniques usedPython scripting
API integration
