We need to link data in Airtable (1 million+ records spread across 20+ bases) to MongoDB (v3.x.x).Most of the data is backend data for our app, in which case the flow is only AT to MDB.Need to create a code that can calculate a scores by pulling from indicators in many different bases and putting result in new database.Our SolutionUsed Python and MongoDB module along with Airtable API to fetch all the data from airtables and push them to the database.
