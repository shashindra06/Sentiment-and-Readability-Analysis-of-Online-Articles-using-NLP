Call-Navigator utilizes an SFTP server that is hosted in AWS, this allows our partner hospital to store patient discharge files directly to an S3 bucket.The application and dashboard are currently up and running and pulling information and data from our partner hospital.

Right now, the only notification and way to view this is strictly through email.– Ability to hover over icons on Facility Dashboard and see info and be able to click on info and have a page with that info pop up.– On the Discharge tab, when setting a filter, we want that filter to stay set unless we change it. Right now, if you set a filter and then go into a patient, when you come back out, the filter is not set anymore and you have to set all over again.Also, let me know if there is a “scope of project” document that we need to complete to help you and your team develop a project plan and timeline. Hopefully, with the above notes and attached files, you’ll be able to put together a project plan and proposal for this project.DeliverablesFully functional application productMaintenance and supportTech StackTools used
